**Why?** for science of course! The data gathered by OSAB includes lux / UV / IR / Visible light, water temp, air temp and humidity, inertial measurements and magnetic fields, water turbidity, water pH, water salinity, air pressure, microphone (bioacoustics). This data will help us better understand ocean environments and let us create a better solution to **fight climate change!**

## üè≥Ô∏è Our Mission

OSAB was created as an open-source solution to climate change. We are told every day how climate change is affecting the world we live in but sometimes it is hard to see those affects ourselves. OSAB‚Äôs goal is to bridge that gap and allow anyone to see firsthand how climate change is affecting our oceans and atmosphere. We hope to prove that scientific research equipment does not have to be tens of thousands of dollars and that anyone can make a difference fighting climate change. Our mission is to educate and inspire young students through STEM and to provide an accessible solution to climate change.
